# Diabetes-data-Analysis
Introduction
The dataset includes multiple medical predictor variables along with a target variable that indicates whether a patient has diabetes.

Motivation: Diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition impacting millions globally. Identifying the factors that lead to diabetes can aid in early detection and preventive measures.

Dataset:
The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset. The attributes of the dataset are as follows:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration measured two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin level (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that estimates the likelihood of diabetes based on family history *Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable indicating diabetes status (0: non-diabetic, 1: diabetic)
